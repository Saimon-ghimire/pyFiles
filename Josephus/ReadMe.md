This is a python program for the popular Josephus problem. For any input number of people, it gives the position(number) of the person that survives.

A sample text file is there where I have exported the one hundered results in the for of coordinates. 
--> (total_number_of_people, position_of_the_person_who_survives)
A graph is made from the coordinates too.
